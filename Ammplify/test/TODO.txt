Facets tested by integration and individually.
Pools file tested on a forked Uniswap Pool
Asset file tested by itself and also with a walk so that the asset node info is filled in.
Fee file tested by a simple storage test but also with two positions with fee differences.
Vault folder tested by copying tests over from burve.

For the view comparison, we'll just test that at a high level against the actual balances when we close a position.
If there's a mismatch we'll dig deeper.

An integration test where we add liquidity into a range,
compute the nodes it should have added to, and check the individual range positions
on uniswap that it matches.
Then we add more and see that the overlapping nodes were updated as expected and the non-overlapping nodes are exact.
Then we borrow liquidity and see that the balances in nodes have reduced.
Then we burn the original liq and see that the leftover is just our second add minus the borrow.
Then we let time pass and see when we add the orginal liq again, the overlapping nodes are higher than before because of compounding.
Then we also swap and remove the second add and see that its still higher than the original plus borrow fees because of compounding the swap fees.
